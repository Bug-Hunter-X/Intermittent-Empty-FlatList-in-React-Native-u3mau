# Intermittent Empty FlatList in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native intermittently renders an empty list, even when data is successfully fetched and processed. The issue appears randomly and doesn't produce any console errors, making debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component is used to display data fetched from an API.  While the data fetching and parsing work correctly, the FlatList sometimes fails to render the data, resulting in an empty list.  This behavior is inconsistent; sometimes it works as expected, other times it doesn't.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the app using `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`.
3. Observe that the FlatList may or may not display the fetched data. The problem is intermittent.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is consistently updated. This can be done by using a `key` prop in the FlatList to uniquely identify each item, preventing re-rendering issues. This is the most probable root cause of the problem, as `index` can become unreliable if items are added or removed.
